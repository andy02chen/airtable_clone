TODO
[ ] UI needs to give the illusion that it’s Airtable, however, doesn’t need to match 1:1
[ ] Just focus on the main page with table, columns, and cells.

DO NEXT
[ ] I want to be able to create a 'view' of a table and save the following configurations
  [ ] Filters on columns: for both numbers (greater than, smaller than) and text (is not empty, is empty, contains, not contains, equal to)
  [ ] Can search through 

[ ] I want to be able to search across all the cells

[ ] Search, filter, and sort have to be done at the database level

[X] Make sure there's a loading state

[ ] The ultimate goal - if there are 1m rows, it can still load without an issue!
