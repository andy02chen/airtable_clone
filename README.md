TODO
[ ] UI needs to give the illusion that it’s Airtable, however, doesn’t need to match 1:1
[ ] Just focus on the main page with table, columns, and cells.

DO NEXT

when i edit a cell and click out/click enter, it doesnt save unless i refresh
clicking tab to go to the next cell isn’t supported yet - IDK
hovering this filter has a cursor pointer but doesn’t have an action so it’s a bit misleading so i think it only needs a cursor pointer on the X part

[ ] I want to be able to create a 'view' of a table and save the following configurations
  [X] Filters on columns
  [X] Sort
  [X] Can search through 

[X] Make sure there's a loading state

[ ] The ultimate goal - if there are 1m rows, it can still load without an issue!
